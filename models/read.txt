No saved model files were included for this project.

The Isolation Forest model was trained dynamically within the Colab notebook during runtime. Due to its low complexity and fast training time, there was no need to export a serialized .pkl or .joblib file for reuse.

This folder is reserved for future use if model persistence becomes necessary (e.g., deployment via API or edge device).
